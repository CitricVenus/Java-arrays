Objectives:

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

    Create and manage arrays in Java.
    Apply array operations to solve real-world problems.
    Use loops to traverse and manipulate array elements.

Project Description:

You are tasked with developing a simple Student Grades Management System. The system will:

    Store grades for a class of students.
    Allow the user to input grades.
    Calculate the average grade.
    Find the highest and lowest grades.
    Display all grades.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setup the Project

    Create a new Java project in your IDE.
    Create a class named StudentGrades.

Step 2: Declare and Initialize Arrays

    Declare an array to store the grades of 10 students.
    Use a Scanner object to allow the user to input grades.

Step 3: Implement Array Operations

    Write code to input grades from the user using a Scanner and store them in the array.
    Write code to calculate and print the average grade.
    Write code to find and print the highest and lowest grades.
    Write code to display all the grades.

Step 5: Main Method

In the main method, write the sequence of operations to:

    Input grades
    Calculate the average grade
    Find the highest and lowest grades
    Display the grades

Learning Outcome:

By completing this project, students will be able to:

    Understand and implement the use of arrays in Java to store and manage data.
    Use loops effectively to iterate over array elements and perform operations such as input, calculation, and display.
    Develop problem-solving skills by implementing a simple real-world application that processes and analyzes data.
    Gain confidence in writing Java programs that interact with users and manage collections of data.
